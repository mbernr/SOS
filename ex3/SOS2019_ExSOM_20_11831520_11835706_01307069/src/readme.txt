This folder contains the data, scripts, and SOMToolbox files used for this project.

The data is contained in mice.csv. See https://www.openml.org/d/40966 for more information on the dataset.
To generate the files necessary to train a SOM with the SOMToolbox, the csv_to_som_input.py script was used.
This script generates the files mice.tv, mice.vec, and mice.cls. To experiment with wrongly scaled data,
the mice_wrongly_scaled.vec file was additionally. generated.

Additionally, the parameter settings for all experiments conducted in this project are contained in
the respective .prop files, which are numbered by the respective experiment number.
